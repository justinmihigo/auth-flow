# React Native App with Expo Navigation

This is a basic React Native app template that demonstrates navigation using Expo Navigation (formerly known as React Navigation in Expo). The app includes two screens: Signup and Login.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justinmihigo/auth-flow.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Metro Bundler. You can then run the app on an emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.
